[[tracing]]
== Tracing utilities

[[trace_objects]]
* *trace_objects*(_boolean_) +
[small]#Enable/disable tracing of objects creation and destruction (which by default
is disabled). +
If enabled, a printf is generated whenever an object is created or deleted,
indicating the object type and the value of its raw handle.#

[[now]]
* _t_ = *now*(&nbsp;) +
[small]#Returns the current time in seconds (a Lua number). +
This is implemented with monotonic _clock_gettime(3)_, if available, or 
with _gettimeofday(3)_ otherwise.#

[[since]]
* _dt_ = *since*(_t_) +
[small]#Returns the time in seconds (a Lua number) elapsed since the time _t_, 
previously obtained with the <<now, now>>(&nbsp;) function.#

[[stats]]
* _mean_, _var_, _min_, _max_ = *stats*(_{number}_) +
[small]#Computes the mean, variance, and the minimum and maximum values for the given array
of numbers.#

[[dumpdata]]
* *dumpdata*(_{number}_, _filename_, [_mode='w'_]) +
[small]#Writes the given array of numbers to the given file file (plain ascii format, two columns index-value). +
The data can then be displayed, for example, using gnuplot (_gnuplot> plot "filename" using 1:2 with lines_). +
_mode_ is the same as in http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-io.open[io.open](&nbsp;).#
