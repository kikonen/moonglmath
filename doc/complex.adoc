== Complex numbers

A complex number *z* = _re_ + iÂ·_im_ (where _i_ is the square root of _-1_) is implemented
as a table holding _re_ and _im_ in its array part (i.e. _{ re, im }_).

The real and imaginary parts are Lua link:++http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#2.1++[number]s
and can be accessed through standard indexing (that is, *z[1]* is the real part _re_, and *z[2]* is
the imaginary part _im_), or using the *re-im* syntactic sugar (*z.re* and *z.im* are aliases for *z[1]* and *z[2]*, respectively).

The following constructor can be used to create complex numbers:

[[glmath.complex]]
* _z_ = *complex*([_re_], [_im_]) +
_z_ = *complex*(_z_) +
_{z~1~, z~2~, ...}_ = *complex*(_{re~1~, im~1~, re~2~, im~2~, ...}_) +
[small]#Create a complex number from its real and imaginary parts (which default to _0_) or from a
previously created complex number _z_.#

[[glmath.tocomplex]]
* _t_ = *tocomplex*(_t_) +
[small]#Turn an appropriately sized table into a complex number, by adding the relevant meta information to it.#

z = glmath.complex(2)            --> z = 2 + 0i

[[glmath.iscomplex]]
* _boolean_ = *iscomplex*(_z_) +
[small]#Returns _true_ if _z_ is a complex number or a Lua number, _false_ otherwise.#

The complex functions and operators listed below are based on the C99 functions
for the complex type 
(see link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_mathematical_functions#complex.h++[<complex.h>] or _man complex(7)_ for more details).

Complex functions accept also real numbers (i.e. plain Lua numbers) as arguments, which they understand
as complex numbers with _im=0_. The same holds for binary complex operators,
where one of the two operands can be a real number (if both are, the standard Lua operators for
numbers are obviously used).


Complex *functions*, also available as methods for their first argument:

* _re_ = *creal*(_z_) +
_im_ = *cimag*(_z_) +
_re_, _im_ = *parts*(_z_) +
_|z|_ = *cabs*(_z_) +
_|z|_ = *norm*(_z_) +
_rad_ = *carg*(_z_) +
_|z|^2^_ = *norm2*(_z_) +
_z/|z|_ = *normalize*(_z_) +
_z^pass:[*]^_ = *conj*(_z_) +
_z~1~_ = *cproj*(_z_) +
_z^-1^_ = *inv*(_z_) +

* _e^z^_ = *cexp*(_z_) +
_ln(z)_ = *clog*(_z_) +
_z^1/2^_ = *csqrt*(_z_) +
_z^w^_ = *cpow*(_z_, _w_) +

* _z~1~_ = *csin*(_z_) +
_z~1~_ = *ccos*(_z_) +
_z~1~_ = *ctan*(_z_) +
_z~1~_ = *casin*(_z_) +
_z~1~_ = *cacos*(_z_) +
_z~1~_ = *catan*(_z_) +
