== Rectangles

MoonGLMATH supports 2D axis-aligned rectangles, which are essentially the same as 2D boxes but specified differently.

A rect *r* is implemented as a table having, in the array part, the coordinates _(x, y)_ of its lower-left corner and its width _w_ and height _h_, as follows: _{ x, y, w, h }_.

The coordinates are Lua link:++http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#2.1++[number]s
and can be accessed through standard indexing (that is, *r[1]* is _x_, *r[2]*
is _y_, and so on). They can also be accessed using the following syntactic sugar: 
*r.x* is an alias for *r[1]*, *r.y* is an alias for *r[2]*, and so on.

The following constructor can be used to create rects.

[[glmath.rect]]
* _r_ = *rect*(_..._) +
[small]#Creates a 2D axis-aligned rect. Values to initialize the rect may be optionally passed as a list of numbers, or as a previously created rect (exceeding values are discarded, while missing values are replaced with zeros). No consistency check is performed on the passed coordinates.#

[[glmath.torect]]
* _t_ = *torect*(_t_) +
[small]#Turn an appropriately sized table into a rect, by adding the relevant meta information to it.#

.examples
[source,lua]
----
r = glmath.rect()              --> r = [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
r = glmath.rect(-1, 1, 2, 3)   --> r = [ -1, 1, 2, 3 ]
----

[[glmath.isrect]]
* _boolean_ = *isrect*(_r_) +
[small]#Check if _r_ is a rect.#
