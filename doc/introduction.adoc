== Introduction

MoonGLMATH is a basic graphics math library in Lua, intended to be used with 
https://github.com/stetre/moongl[MoonGL] and the other libraries of the
https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs[MoonLibs collection] (but it does not depend on them, and viceversa).

By now it has only the minimal features needed for graphics programming: real vectors and real matrices
up to 4 and 4x4 dimensions, quaternions, 2D and 3D axis-aligned bounding boxes, complex numbers, and a few functions to generate transformation matrices.

Like MoonGL and the other <<see-also, companion libraries>>, it is not designed for
performance but for ease of use (the main purpose of these libraries is to lighten the burden
of programming while studying computer graphics).
